            <h2>About HollisWealth</h2>
            <p>At HollisWealth, we approach wealth management from a different point of view. 
               A point of view rooted in the thinking that we should have deeper relationships with advisors, investors and employees. 
               When we do, we can provide our advisors with the tools they need to craft holistic solutions for their clients. 
               
               In the wealth management business, we work with numbers. That's no surprise. But numbers don't define our success as a firm. 
               Because investors are more than just statistics. They're people. People who have goals. Helping people achieve those goals is how we define success. 
               That's why we look for advisors and employees who are astute and empathetic. 
               Individuals who are business smart but are also approachable, respectful and easy to talk to.

               While our advisors have the freedom to provide independent advice, they are also backed by iA Securities, 
               a leading wealth management company with one of the largest advisory networks in Canada.
