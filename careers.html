               <p>We're happy you're here and hope that you can stay. We're always looking for smart 
                  and personable individuals to become part of our team. People who follow our philosophy 
                  that an investor is more than just a client. They're a person, or a couple, or a family 
                  who has something they want to achieve. All they need is a little support. Are you someone 
                  who can provide that? At HollisWealth, we have always believed that looking at things from 
                  a different perspective gives us a better opportunity to protect and grow our clients’ wealth. 
                  However, beyond the holistic solutions, investment strategies and tools we offer, cultivating 
                  a special point of view really begins with the relationships we build every day. It’s those 
                  relationships, with advisors and employees, that form the bedrock of our success. And it’s why 
                  we’re dedicated to promoting a personal approach – one that encourages team work, and the sharing 
                  of ideas, and ensures everyone in our organization is listened to and treated with the dignity and 
                  freedom they deserve. After all, inspiring strong and lasting connections is the only way we can 
                  continue to build our dynamic team and achieve excellence.At HollisWealth, we believe that a solution 
                  can come from one brain or from many. So depending on if we're trying to perfect a tool for an advisor 
                  or are helping them find the right solution for a client, we want the door for collaboration to always 
                  be open. Overall, we’re looking for people who aren’t afraid to work independently or in concert with others.
